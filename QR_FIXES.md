# QR Generator & Scanner Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve QR code generation and scanning issues in the HOYN! application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. QR Generator Not Visible (SSR Issues)
**Problem**: QR codes were not rendering properly due to Next.js Server-Side Rendering incompatibilities.

**Solution**: 
- Created a new `ClientQRGenerator` component that ensures client-side rendering only
- Used `useEffect` to ensure components only render on the client side
- Added proper loading states to improve user experience

### 2. QR Download Issues (Timing Problems)
**Problem**: Downloaded QR codes were corrupted because the download was triggered before the canvas was fully rendered.

**Solution**:
- Added an `isReady` state that tracks when the QR code is fully rendered
- Disabled the download button until the QR code is ready
- Implemented proper error handling for download failures

### 3. QR Scanner Parsing Issues
**Problem**: Scanned QR codes were not being parsed correctly, leading to broken redirects or 404 pages.

**Solution**:
- Improved the `handleScan` function to better parse different QR content formats
- Added validation for URLs and usernames
- Enhanced redirect logic to handle both internal and external URLs properly

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/components/qr/ClientQRGenerator.tsx` - New client-side QR generator component
2. `src/app/dashboard/qr-test/page.tsx` - Test page for QR functionality
3. `src/components/qr/ClientQRGenerator.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the new component

### Files Modified:
1. `src/app/dashboard/qr-generator/page.tsx` - Updated to use the new ClientQRGenerator
2. `src/app/scan/page.tsx` - Improved QR scanning and parsing logic
3. `src/components/qr/index.ts` - Updated exports to include new component

## Technical Implementation Details

### ClientQRGenerator Component
- Uses `useState` and `useEffect` to ensure client-side rendering
- Implements proper loading states
- Uses `QRCodeCanvas` from `qrcode.react` for better compatibility
- Includes download functionality with proper timing checks
- Has built-in error handling

### QR Scanner Improvements
- Enhanced URL validation and parsing
- Better handling of different QR content types
- Improved redirect logic for both internal and external URLs
- Added proper error messages for unsupported QR codes

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. QR codes now render correctly on all pages
2. Download functionality works without producing corrupted files
3. QR scanner properly parses and redirects different types of QR content
4. Error handling works as expected

### Automated Testing
- Created unit tests for the ClientQRGenerator component
- Tests cover rendering, download functionality, and error handling
